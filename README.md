**Discription**
A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to manage the operations of a library. It helps in organizing and controlling various functions such as book cataloging, user registration, borrowing and returning books, tracking overdue items, and maintaining records of library resources. The system can also generate reports, facilitate book reservations, and provide an efficient way for both staff and users to interact with library resources.
